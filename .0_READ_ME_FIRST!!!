This is longterm support kernel version 3.0.x sources.
Based on 3.0.8 kernel version with Rockchip rk3066 SoC support.

All patches till 3.0.100 version applyed. See kernel.org for more info.


We still need some closed source kernel modules (rk30xxnand_ko.ko.3.0.8+ only now).
DO NOT alter SUBLEVEL in Makefile from 8 to any other! Keep it 3.0.8+ if you want mount nand partitions.
Or you need update rknand code too (3.0.8 code might not work with 3.0.36 and 3.0.72 rk30xxnand modules proper!).
